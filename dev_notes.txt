# ROS Install
This metapackage uses vcstool to keep track of 3rd party packages that must be built from source
See ROS page on vcstool for context
Repositories can be imported with "vcs import src/ < src/nightingale/nightingale.rosinstall && vcs import src/ < src/kinova-movo/movo.rosinstall" from the root of the ws


# Simulation
Simulation of Movo in hospital can be spawned with <roslaunch nightingale_simulation hospital.launch>
See "Moving the base" section in the kinova-movo dev_notes.txt for instructions on moving the base in simulation

# Mapping
launch gmapping with <roslaunch nightingale_navigation mapping.launch>
drive the robot around and generate the map
the map is publsihed to /map. you can visualize it through rviz
save the map with <rosrun map_server map_saver -f 'map'>

# Localization
launch the map server and amcl with <roslaunch nightingale_navigation localization.launch>
the /particlecloud topic shows the estimated pose array. you can visualize it through rviz

younes todo add steps for the move base launch file

younes todo delete below
In sim:
Always run roslaunch nightingale_simulation hospital.launch
in another terminal run rosrun rviz rviz -d $(rospack find movo_viz)/rviz/robot.rviz

for mapping then run: roslaunch nightingale_navigation mapping.launch
for localization run: roslaunch nightingale_navigation localization.launch

for localization and move_base run both: roslaunch nightingale_navigation localization.launch and roslaunch nightingale_navigation move_base.launch
